# spotify-grid-card
This is a reusable **Home Assistant Lovelace custom card** that implements our “Spotify Grid — 4col” layout with a Dark VisionOS look. It shows a media header (transport controls &amp; state) and a 4‑column, image‑driven grid of Playlists/Artists/Albums/Tracks that tap‑to‑play via `media_player.play_media`.
